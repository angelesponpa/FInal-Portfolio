      <h6> About Me</h6>
                
           
     <p class="description-small">
        I am Angeles Ponpa, a 2024-2025 graduate journalism student at Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism, specializing in Politics, Policy, and Foreign Affairs with a focus on data-driven reporting.
</p>
<p class="description-small">
        My passion for journalism began at a young age when I conducted my first interviews on a local food shortage in my hometown of Aurora, IL. Over time, my interest in politics grew, leading me to earn an undergraduate 
        degree in Political Science and Sociology. I worked on political campaigns, ran for local office, and served in the Illinois Senate, but ultimately, I realized my true calling was in journalism—informing the
         public with accurate, compelling, and impactful stories.
        </p>

<p class="description-small"
        Last summer, I took an independent approach to investigative journalism, reporting on Mexico’s narco-government theories and local Catholic events, including a widely discussed case of an alleged Virgin Mary
        apparition shedding human tears.
    </p>
   <p class="description-small">
        Today, my work focuses on Mexican politics, U.S.-Mexico relations, immigration, and Catholic affairs worldwide. Through multimedia storytelling and data-driven analysis, I strive to deliver insightful, 
        well-researched journalism that engages and informs audiences.
            </p>
