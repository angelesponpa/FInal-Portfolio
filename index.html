<h5> Narcoviolencia, Deforestation, and the illegal trading of lumber in Mexico </h5>
<h6> How years of illegal deforestation in rural parts of Mexico and irregulated climate policy has lead to violence and loss of forest areas </h6>
<h6> By. Angeles Ponpa</h6>

<p class="description-small">
    Mexico’s lush forests, spanning from the Yucatan peninsula to the rugged terrain of Michoacan, are disappearing at an alarming rate. The country has long struggled with illegal logging, but in recent years, powerful cartels have turned deforestation into a lucrative business, operating within a murky web of illicit trade, weak enforcement, and economic pressures exacerbated by global demand. </p>

    <p class="description-small">
According to Global Forest Watch, Mexico lost over 4.8 million hectares of tree cover between 2001 and 2021. According to Forest Policy Research, in 2021 alone, 95% of logging in the country was deemed illegal. Despite technological advancements and government reform initiatives to curb illegal action in forests of Mexico, illegal logging remains a driving force of Mexico’s forest loss, often tied to criminal organizations profiting from the illicit lumber trade. </p>

    <p class="description-small">
For decades, Mexico’s criminal organizations focused on drug trafficking. As security efforts intensified, cartels diversified, finding new revenue streams in natural resources. Illegal logging, particularly in regions such as the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve and parts of Oaxaca, have become a million dollar industry.  According to the United States Trade Representative, In Mexico, it is estimated that between 5 and 14 million m³ of illegally harvested wood are sold each year, and that that the trade in illegal wood represents a business of $7,000 to $20,000 million pesos or $342 to $978 million USD.” The same smuggling routes used for narcotics now transport illicit timber, much of which ends up in the United States and beyond.</p>

<p class="description-small">
Reports from NBC News highlight that cartels impose “timber taxes” on local communities, forcing landowners and loggers to pay extortion fees or face violent repercussions. Those who resist often meet grim fates. The environmental watchdog, Global Witness, documented a sharp increase in the murders of land defenders, with Mexico ranking among the deadliest countries for environmental activists in recent years. </p>

<p class="description-small">

The United States has implemented strict tariffs and import regulations aimed at controlling illegal timber trade. However, these policies have had unintended consequences. High tariffs on legally sourced Mexican wood have pushed businesses and consumers toward cheaper, unregulated alternatives- fueling demand for illicitly harvested timber. The Forest Trend risk assessment tool indicates that despite international efforts to curb illegal logging, Mexico’s tiber market remains deeply compromised. </p>

<p class="description-small">

Recent policy shifts have exacerbated the situation. In March 2025, the U.S. government launched a new investigation into Mexican lumber imports, reigniting trade tensions between the two nations, said Reuters. The move, reminiscent of past tariffs imposed under the Trump administration, has led to concerns that legal Mexican timber exports could face even greater restrictions, pushing more loggers into black-market operations controlled by criminal groups.
</p>

<p class="description-small">
A report from the South Carolina Forestry Commission notes that Mexico already struggles with a complex and often inefficient forestry regulation system, making compliance difficult for legitimate producers. When tariffs and trade restrictions increase, many small-scale loggers and businesses are left with few options but to operate outside legal frameworks, either by cutting corners or by working under cartel-controlled supply chains. </p>

<p class="description-small">

Mexico has attempted to combat illegal deforestation with satellite monitoring and advanced tracking technology, said Mexico Business News. The government has partnered with international organizations to improve transparency in the timber industry, but results have been mixed. The introduction of AI-powered surveillance and satellite imagery to detect illegal deforestation has led to a few high-profile seizures, yet enforcement remains limited in cartel-dominated areas. </p>

<p class="description-small">
The Mexican government’s 2022 Taxonomía Sostenible outlines a framework for sustainable land use, siad an UNDP Report, but local communities still bear the brunt of enforcement challenges. There is stress for the need for stronger collaboration between federal authorities, indigenous communities, and international stakeholders to break the cycle of illegal deforestation. </p>

<p class="description-small">
The war against deforestation in Mexico is more than an environmental battle- it is a human rights crisis. Activists, journalists, and local leaders who speak out against illegal logging face threats, displacement, and violence. According to Global Witness, Mexico saw one of its highest numbers of environmental defenders killing in 2022.
Mexico’s deforestation crisis is deeply intertwined with the country’s ongoing struggles against organized crime and economic instability. one that includes stronger enforcement, economic alternatives for communities, and better-regulated trade policies that do not unintentionally benefit illicit industries. </p>

<p class="description-small">
International cooperation will also play a key role. As long as global demand for cheap timber, avocados, and other high-risk commodities continues, criminal enterprises will find ways to exploit Mexico’s forests. Consumer awareness, stricter supply chain regulations, and support for sustainable initiatives must become global priorities.
In the face of mounting environmental and human costs, Mexico stands at a crossroads. The choice is clear: implement decisive action now or risk losing not just its forests, but the lives and livelihoods of those who depend on them.
